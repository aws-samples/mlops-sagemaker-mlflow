    "# Register ML Model using SageMaker\n",
    "After training an ML model, you might want to evaluate its performance and have it reviewed by a data scientist or MLOps engineer in your organization before using it in production. To do this, you can register your model versions to the SageMaker model registry. The SageMaker model registry is a repository that data scientists or engineers can use to catalog machine learning (ML) models and manage model versions and their associated metadata, such as training metrics. They can also manage and log the approval status of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you register your model versions to the SageMaker model registry, a data scientist or your MLOps team can access the SageMaker model registry through SageMaker Studio. Additionally, the data scientist or MLOps team can evaluate your model and update its approval status. If the model doesnâ€™t perform to their requirements, the data scientist or MLOps team can update the status to `Rejected`. If the model does perform to their requirements, then the data scientist or MLOps team can update the status to `Approved`. Then, they can deploy your model to an endpoint or automate model deployment with CI/CD pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the SageMaker model registry feature to seamlessly integrate models with the MLOps processes in your organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram summarizes an example of registering a model version built in SageMaker Studio to the SageMaker model registry for integration into an MLOps workflow.\n",

    "## Model Registration\n",
    "With a model registry, you can version control the model that you train, similar to version control software code. When version control is enabled, you can track the performance of the model over time and make informed decisions about using the best model to serve in your production environment. The SageMaker Model Registry is structured as several Model (Package) Groups with model packages in each group. These Model Groups can optionally be added to one or more Collections. Each model package in a Model Group corresponds to a trained model. The version of each model package is a numerical value that starts at 1 and is incremented with each new model package added to a Model Group. For example, if 5 model packages are added to a Model Group, the model package versions will be 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  \n",
